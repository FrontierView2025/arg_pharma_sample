<h1>Healthcare takes greater share of national spending after a year and a half of austerity from Milei</h1>

<p>Healthcare spending has proven an exception as the share of national spending allocated to healthcare has risen despite an aggressive austerity agenda from the Milei administration. This is being driven by sharp real declines in other areas compared to healthcare in 2024, which actually increased in real terms after strong spending in H2 2024. In 2023, healthcare spending was 3.6% of government spending, but in 2025, healthcare has accounted for 5.9% of spending.</p>

<p>Improved budget execution in 2024 — particularly in the second half — has contributed to a small increase in healthcare spending in real terms. This contrasts sharply with other major budget areas, which faced real cuts. The increase in execution may also reflect structural shifts in how healthcare programs are being prioritized and managed.</p>
